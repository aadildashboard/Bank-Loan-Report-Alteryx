# Bank Loan Report Project (Alteryx Workflow)

Welcome to the Bank Loan Report Project!

This repository provides a detailed Alteryx workflow designed to generate a comprehensive bank loan report. The report aims to:

Monitor Key Loan Metrics: Track essential loan-related metrics like total applications, funded amounts, received amounts, average interest rates, and average debt-to-income (DTI) ratios.
Evaluate Loan Quality: Categorize loans into "Good" and "Bad" based on pre-defined loan status criteria, assessing loan portfolio performance.
Visualize Trends: Create insightful dashboards utilizing various charts (line, filled maps, donuts, bars, tree maps) for a deeper understanding of loan activities and trends.
Present Detailed Overview: Offer a consolidated view of key loan-related metrics and data points, providing a holistic perspective on loan performance.
Dashboard Design (Illustrative Examples):

Loan Repayment Details (Payment History, Remaining Balance, Delinquency Status, etc.)
How to Use This Project:

Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone https://your-username/Bank-Loan-Report-Alteryx.git
Use code with caution.

Open the Alteryx Workflow:
The repository should contain an Alteryx workflow file (e.g., Bank_Loan_Report.yxmd).
Open this file using Alteryx Designer.
Configure Input Data Source:
Update the workflow's input data source to point to your actual loan data location (e.g., CSV, Excel, database).
